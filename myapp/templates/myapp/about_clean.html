  <p>
    ScrapSort is a smart digital waste management web app that detects waste using AI and classifies it into categories such as recyclable, organic, e-waste, and general waste. It provides eco-friendly solutions for managing each type while allowing users to compare real-time scrap prices per kilogram across multiple platforms, helping them get the best value for their recyclables. The app also shows the nearest dump yards and recycling centers, making it easier for individuals and businesses to dispose of waste responsibly. For bulk waste disposal measured in tons, ScrapSort offers location-based options to connect with collection centers. A user-friendly dashboard tracks waste history, earnings, and eco-impact, encouraging sustainable practices. By combining detection, price comparison, and disposal guidance, ScrapSort makes waste management digital, profitable, and sustainable.
